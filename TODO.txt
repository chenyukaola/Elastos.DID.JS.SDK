List of things to consider while migrating:
===========================================

- Multiple constructors not allowed in TS
    => use instanceof and typeof checks inside a single constructor() when the number of parameters is the same.
    => Use a builder is this gets more complex than this.
- No namespace access control, no better choice than using "public" modifiers everywhere?

- Beware of byte[] replaced with "string" for all crypto operations.
    => Some libraries use string, some others use Buffer. We have started to use string but
    I would be tempted to use Buffer everywhere, strings may do weird character conversions.
- Exceptions may be better put in their respective parent classes rather than flattened in a exception.ts file. Let's see how it goes during tests and exceptions catching


NOTE:
- extensions.ts contains helper methods for classes like string, arrays. This is inherited from Swift behaviour and
this is quite convenient. We may keep adding helpers there in that way.

Ricardo:
- Stop using CryptoJS and "../hdkey-secp256r1" - replace with bitcore-lib and previous libs from the JS version
- Maybe don't use the bip39 lib for mnemonics in case this is already handled by existing libs like bitcore (to reduce the number of dependencies / code size)
- Dispatch content of DEPRECATED_core.ts everywhere needed in the new files structure.
- Continue to enrich the "crypto/" folder with all helpers with need for convenience: base64, base58, bip39, sha256, key management, derivations, etc.
- Continue to replace usage of "strings" with "Buffers" everywhere crypto is involved. Using strings was influenced by the CryptoJS library but we want to revert back to Buffers everywhere.

Carl:
- Keep focusing on JSON serialization / deserialization / xml handling.
- Make sure to finalize what can't build to get a buildable SDK asap (even if this means commenting out some code).

Ben:
- Migrate DefaultDIDAdapter and FileSystemStorage.
- Get the DID store class ready for the initial tests (uncomment commented code)

Ricardo / Carl / Ben:
- Migrate tests from java. Convert to Jest format. Start with didstore.test.ts.
