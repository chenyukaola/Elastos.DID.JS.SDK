List of things to consider while migrating:
===========================================

- Multiple constructors not allowed in TS
    => use instanceof and typeof checks inside a single constructor() when the number of parameters is the same.
    => Use a builder is this gets more complex than this.
- No namespace access control, no better choice than using "public" modifiers everywhere?
- Exceptions may be better put in their respective parent classes rather than flattened in a exception.ts file. Let's see how it goes during tests and exceptions catching

NOTE:
- extensions.ts contains helper methods for classes like string, arrays. This is inherited from Swift behaviour and
this is quite convenient. We may keep adding helpers there in that way.
