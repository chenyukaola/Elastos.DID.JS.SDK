List of things to consider while migrating:
===========================================

- Multiple constructors not allowed in TS
    => use instanceof and typeof checks inside a single constructor() when the number of parameters is the same.
    => Use a builder is this gets more complex than this.
- No namespace access control, no better choice than using "public" modifiers everywhere?
- JSONFactory, XML parsing
    => Antlr4-ts
- HDKeys, BIP39 management.
    => hdkeys: https://www.npmjs.com/package/hdkey-secp256r1 (also for signature/verification)
    => bip39: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bip39 (jingyu)
- What about MD5Digest, SHA256Digest libraries?
    => https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js

- TODO: replace our custom LRUCache with an existing library (typescript-lru-cache) with TTL.
